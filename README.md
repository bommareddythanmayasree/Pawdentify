# 🐾 Pawdentify  
### AI-Powered Dog Breed Identification & Insight System

Pawdentify is an **AI-driven dog breed identification system** that leverages **deep learning (CNNs + transfer learning)** to classify dog breeds from images and provide meaningful breed insights such as temperament, grooming needs, health risks, and training difficulty through a simple and intuitive interface.

## 🚀 Why Pawdentify?

Identifying a dog’s breed helps owners understand:
- Behavior and temperament
- Grooming and care needs
- Potential health risks
- Training requirements  

Pawdentify bridges this gap using **computer vision and AI**, making breed identification fast, accurate, and informative.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🐕 **Dog breed prediction** from uploaded images  
- 🧠 **CNN-based deep learning model** with transfer learning  
- 📊 **Detailed breed insights**, including:
  - Temperament
  - Grooming needs
  - Common health risks
  - Training difficulty  
- ⚡ **Fast and lightweight backend inference**
- 🧩 Clean and modular project structure

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads a dog image  
2. Image is preprocessed and passed to a trained CNN model  
3. Model predicts the most likely dog breed  
4. Breed-specific information is fetched and displayed to the user
